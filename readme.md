Welcome! This is JavaScript30, a 30-day Vanilla JavaScript challenge. This has obviously been forked from another repository, and the solutions are likely going to be the same as others you'll see. If you'd like to try it yourself, go [here](https://JavaScript30.com). Thanks to [Wes Bos!](https://github.com/wesbos)

## A note on Pull Requests

These are meant to be 1:1 copies of what is done in the video. If you found a better / different way to do things, great, but I will be keeping them the same as the videos.

The starter files + solutions will be updated if/when the videos are updated.

Thanks!
